2. Clone your fork locally:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/YOUR_USERNAME/markitdown-mcp.git
   cd markitdown-mcp
   ```

## üíª Development Setup

1. **Create a virtual environment:**
   ```bash
   python -m venv venv
   source venv/bin/activate  # On Windows: venv\Scripts\activate
   ```

2. **Install in development mode:**
   ```bash
   pip install -e .
   ```

3. **Install development dependencies:**
   ```bash
   pip install -e ".[dev]"
   ```

4. **Verify installation:**

   markitdown-mcp --help
   ```

## üîß Making Changes

### Branch Naming Convention
- `feat/` - New features
- `fix/` - Bug fixes
- `docs/` - Documentation updates
- `test/` - Test improvements
- `refactor/` - Code refactoring

Example: `feat/add-new-file-format` or `fix/mcp-protocol-error`

### Development Workflow

1. **Create a feature branch:**
   ```bash
   git checkout -b feat/your-feature-name
   ```

2. **Make your changes:**
   - Follow existing code style
   - Add tests for new functionality
   - Update documentation as needed

3. **Test your changes:**
   ```bash
   # Test MCP server functionality
   python -c "
   import json
   import subprocess
   test_request = {'jsonrpc': '2.0', 'id': 1, 'method': 'tools/list', 'params': {}}
   proc = subprocess.run(['markitdown-mcp'], input=json.dumps(test_request), 
                        capture_output=True, text=True)
   print('‚úÖ Server working' if proc.stdout else '‚ùå Server error')
   "
   ```

4. **Format code (if you have dev dependencies):**
   ```bash
   black markitdown_mcp/
   isort markitdown_mcp/
   ```

### Code Style Guidelines
- Follow PEP 8 Python style guide
- Use meaningful variable and function names
- Add docstrings to all functions and classes
- Keep functions focused and small
- Use type hints where appropriate

### Adding New File Format Support
If you want to add support for a new file format:

1. Check if MarkItDown library already supports it
2. Update the `supported_extensions` set in `markitdown_mcp/server.py`
3. Add the format to the README documentation
4. Test with sample files
5. Update the format count in documentation if needed
